# Django Project: 'Today I Learned'

###### A Class-based social platform allowing users to share posts, follow each other, and more.

Partially created using [Kalob Taulien's online Full Stack Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/) on Udemy.

It has since been taken further independently, and there are further plans to implement the following in the future:
- Cleaner, more efficient testing with better code coverage
- REST Framework
- Update personal user information securely
